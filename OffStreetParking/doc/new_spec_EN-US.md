Entity: OffStreetParking  
========================  
This specification is a **temporal version**. It is automatically generated from the  documented properties described in the schema.json condensed into the file `model.yaml`. A temporary `new_model.yaml` file has been created in every data model to avoid impacting into existing scripts. Thus, the specification will be incomplete as long as the schema.json is not updated to the new format (documenting properties). Once updated the `model.yaml` (`new_model.yaml`) needs to be updated as well (automatically) . Further info in this [link](https://github.com/smart-data-models/data-models/blob/master/specs/warning_message_new_spec.md). As long as it is a provisional format any [feedback is welcomed in this form](https://smartdatamodels.org/index.php/submit-an-issue-2/) choosing option `Feedback on the new specification`

Required properties  
- `id`  - `location`  - `type`    
A site, off street, intended to park vehicles, managed independently and with suitable and clearly marked access points (entrances and exits). If necessary, and for management purposes or to deal with multi-location parking sites, it can be divided into different zones modelled by the entity type [ParkingGroup](../ParkingGroup/README.md) . In DATEX 2 version 2.3 terminology it corresponds to a _UrbanParkingSite_ of type _offStreetParking_.
